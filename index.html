<h2>CLIMATIC CHANGE </h2>
<h4>Abstract </h4>
	<p>
	According to NASA and IPCC, Global temperature has increased by 1.4 oF since 1880, CO2 levels has reached 400.71 parts per billion, loss of world’s forest cover between the period 2000 and 2012 is 1.5 million square km, reduction of land ice 287 billion metric ton per year, sea level rise is 3.2 mm per year and loss of arctic ice cover at the rate of 13.3% per decade. Increasing risk of irreversible changes due to large scale shift in the climate system such as several sensitive species such as ocean corals, aquatic birds, reptiles such as sea turtles and amphibians are facing extinction, failing of crops cause famine in many East African countries, decrease in potable water in Mediterranean and Southern Africa and increasing intensity of extreme events such as forest fires (Australia and Indonesia), flooding(Bangladesh) , storm events (tornadoes and hurricanes in USA), droughts (Sahal region) and deadly heat waves (in India 2015) recorded in many parts of the world.

Anthropogenic release of greenhouse gases CO2, CH4, water vapour, N2O, O3, HFCs, PFCs and SF6¬reflects a portion of solar energy back to the earth, this increases the temperature, causes changes in ocean currents, seasonal weather patterns and ultimately changes the climate. Deforestation reduces the CO2 sink and it further enhances the greenhouse effect. Several mitigation methods such as use of alternative green energy sources, reducing the use of fossil fuels, use of greenhouse gas reduction techniques during the emission, carbon capture & carbon sequestration, afforestation, reforestation, protection of existing forest reserves, silviculture and agroforestry are being facilitated by several international, government and non-governmental organizations. Climate change issue can be handled either adapting to the change or disaster risk reduction. UNDP has suggested a three step method to work on Carbon finance consist of removal of barriers to climate friendly technologies, establishing efficient host country procedures for clean development mechanism (CDM) and develop projects via millennium development goal (MDG) carbon facility. An Integrated Territorial Climate Plan (ITCP) was designed for regional governments to plan their activities including financing climate change mitigation process. This paper briefly evaluates anthropocene global climate change and its human solutions.

<p>Introduction</p>
Naturally variation in solar irradiance, variations in  orbital  parameters  of  earth  and  volcanic activities  cause  climate  change.  Portion  of incoming  solar  energy  reflects  back  to  space. However, a  portion of such  outgoing  energy is absorbed  by  atmospheric  gases  this  also  helps to  keep  the  temperature  warmer  (this  is  the reason  earth  is  warmer  than  moon)  In  case  if this  natural  heat  trapping  properties  are  not available  the  average  surface  temperature  of the  earth  would  be  about  33oC  lower  (IPCC, 2001)  the  gases which  trap the  heat  energy  is known  as  greenhouse  gases.  Recent  decades, after  the  industrial  revolution  the  amount  of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere has greatly  increased  due  to  human  emission  of GHG  and  removal  of  natural  sinks  such  as deforestation  and  oceanic  pollution.

 This process of increase in greenhouse effect causes warming  of  the  earth  surface  and  alters  the energy  transfer  between  atmosphere,  space, land  and  the  oceans.  This  phenomenon  is referred  as  global  warming.  In  addition,  solar energy  or  temperature  is  the  driving  force  of earth’s  weather  pattern  as  it  drives  the  wind, ocean currents, humidity pattern, movement of clouds,etc, thus, the global climate get changed. This also intensify the effect of natural disasters such  as  storms,  flooding  rain,  landslides, drought, land degradation and agricultural loss, species loss and epidemics.  Greenhouse gases give positive radiative forcing (net increase in the energy absorption by earth) due  to  increase  in  radiatively  active  natural greenhouse  gases  such  as  CO2,  CH4,  water vapour, N2O, O3. In addition HFCs, PFCs and SF6 are  anthropogenic in  origin and  are  accounted in  national  greenhouse  gas  inventories.  There are  several  gases  influencing  the  global radiation  budget  such  as  CO,  NO2,  SO2  and secondary  pollutants  such  as  tropospheric ozone (formed in reaction with volatile organic compounds  with  oxides  of  nitrogen  under  UV radiation).  Begin  with  industrialization  burning of  fossil  fuel  alone  causes  30%  increase  in  the concentration  of  greenhouse  gases (GHG).Earth’s surface temperature has risen by 0.18oC  during  last  century  and  the  projected rise of current (21st) century is ranging between 1.1  and  6.4 oC  (IPCC,  2007).  In  the  period ranging 1750-2001 increase in CO2 was by 31%, 150% for methane and 16% for nitrous oxide in the atmosphere.
